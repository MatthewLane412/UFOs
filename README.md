# UFOs

## Overview
In this analysis, I am using JavaScript, HTML and css to create a web page designed for UFO sitings. I am given a javaScript file filled with sightings information to start the analysis. I built the functionality for filtering, and table information in JavaScript, the styling in css, and the webpage interface in HTML (e.g, table, jumbotron, header, text boxes, etc.).
